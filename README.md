# GMC v2 Demo - Debug Project

This is merely a copy of Grim's GMCv2 Demo, suitable for creating a quick branch to help people test things. To use any given branch, check it out. It assumes you have GMC installed at an engine level; if that's not true, you'll want to copy your `GMC` directory into the `Plugins` directory.
